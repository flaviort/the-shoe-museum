				<h2>
					Product(s) Arrived Damaged or Defective?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Darn pot holes! If our sustainable packaging and shipping materials didn’t protect your products perfectly, it’s not their fault, it’s those darn potholes!  Help us out by taking a picture of the damage.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Action Plan:</b> Email <a href='mailto:returns@cypresshemp.com'>returns@cypresshemp.com</a> with your confirmation # in the subject line, a clear picture of the damage, and a statement similar to “My product arrived damaged, I’d like to..."
				</p>

				<h2>
					Receive the wrong hemp product?
				</h2>

				<p>
					If you think we’ve shipped you the wrong product, please forgive us! We’re humans, not robots! We’ll make it right with a smile!
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Action Plan:</b> Email <a href='mailto:returns@cypresshemp.com'>returns@cypresshemp.com</a> with your confirmation # in the subject line, a clear picture of the incorrect product, and a statement similar to “I received the wrong product, I’d like to initiate an exchange.”
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.
					</b>
				</p>

						If you think something’s taking too long, please contact us at <a href='mailto:returns@cypresshemp.com'>returns@cypresshemp.com</a>.

				<h2>
					Exchange Eligibility and Returns by Mail
				</h2>

				<p>
					To be eligible for an exchange, your item(s) must have arrived damaged or defective or not be the item(s) that were ordered by you. To approve your exchange, we require a confirmation # or proof of purchase. Once your exchange is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item and will be sending you the exchange. After receiving our Exchange Initiation email, you have 10 days to get the item(s) to us until the exchange is potentially considered void.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are a small company, so, for now, <b>you will be responsible for paying the return shipping costs for exchanging your item.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					You should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We can’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
