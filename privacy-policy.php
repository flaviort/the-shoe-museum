					Security
				</h2>

				<p>
					We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
				</p>

				<p>
					Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
				</p>

				<p>
					While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Orders
				</h2>

				<p>
					We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Cookies
				</h2>

				<p>
					We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, payment processors). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Sharing
				</h2>

				<p>
					We may share aggregated demographic information with our potential partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
				</p>

				<p>
					We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies may retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for secondary purposes beyond filling your order.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Links
				</h2>

				<p>
					This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site, and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Surveys & Contests
				</h2>

				<p>
					From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
